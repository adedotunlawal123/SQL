WHERE banned = 'Yes'),

Trips_by_unbanned AS (SELECT request_at , COUNT(client_id) AS cnt_1
FROM Trips
WHERE client_id NOT IN(SELECT * FROM banned)
AND driver_id NOT IN(SELECT * FROM banned)
GROUP BY request_at
HAVING request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03'),


Trips_by_unbanned_cancelled AS (SELECT request_at , COUNT(client_id) AS cnt_2
FROM Trips
WHERE client_id NOT IN(SELECT * FROM banned)
AND status != 'completed'

HAVING request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03')


SELECT T_1.request_at AS Day, ROUND(IFNULL(cnt_2/cnt_1, 0.00), 2) AS 'Cancellation Rate'
FROM Trips_by_unbanned AS T_1
LEFT OUTER JOIN Trips_by_unbanned_cancelled AS T_2
